# PreProcessing
#This repository would throw light on Preprocessing  of the data.

 Here we will be learning about the data PreProcessing. 
# In ML , it is very important to cleanse the data before its feed to the model. Without this cleaning the model
# would not work. The model will give wrong prediction. Hence we need to put an effort to make data work for the model.
# The data cleaning for each model might vary at the detail level But Basic data preprocessing is same for every model.
# Here in this section, we will be concentrating on Basic processing for each model.
# We are using two sets of data to make concepts clear.
# One data is country and average income and other is companoes and their profit data.


# This is very basic tutorial for beginners. Along the learning path we will keep on adding more adavnce features.
